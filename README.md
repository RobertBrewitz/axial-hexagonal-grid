# Test-suite

Using jasmine-node, jasmine-reporters and guard to trigger specs when files change.

## Setup Test Environment

Requires ruby, node.js, npm and Cairo with xcb-shm from X11.

### Node Canvas and Cairo (on OS X Mavericks)

Using (node-)canvas for some specs which requires Cairo.

I installed Cairo with Homebrew, so I had to symlink some files from /opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig to /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig before I could install (node-)canvas as such:

```
    $ ln -s /opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/{xcb-shm,xcb,pthread-stubs,xau,xproto,xdmcp,xcb-render,xrender,renderproto,x11,kbproto,xext,xextproto}.pc /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```

Go to project folder and run:

```
    $ bundle install
    $ npm install
```

### Hickups

In-case you get "out of memory" errors in the specs, it might be because of a conflict between pixman and libpng.

```
    $ brew uninstall pixman cairo libpng
    $ brew install pixman cairo libpng
    $ npm rebuild canvas
```

## Auto-running specs

Go to project folder and run:

```
    $ guard
```

## Manually running specs

Go to project folder and run:

```
    $ npm test
```
